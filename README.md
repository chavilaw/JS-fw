TinyUI is a lightweight educational frontend framework built from scratch using plain JavaScript.
It allows developers to build single-page applications by declaratively describing user interfaces,
while the framework manages DOM rendering, state updates, routing, event delegation and performance optimizations.

TinyUI is designed to demonstrate the core concepts behind modern frontend frameworks without relying on external dependencies.
