Chose to use Dot.js in this project 

Dot.js is a lightweight educational frontend framework built from scratch using plain JavaScript.
It allows developers to build single-page applications by declaratively describing user interfaces,
while the framework manages DOM rendering, state updates, routing, event delegation and performance optimizations.

Dot.js is designed to demonstrate the core concepts behind modern frontend frameworks without relying on external dependencies.
